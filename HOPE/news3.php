 and other institutions. </p>

insurance type.Governments and public health systems have been forced to deal with the 
immediate effects of the virus, and in efforts to contain it. This trend
 will undoubtedly continue into the future, as the public purse will come 
 under increasing pressure.
 Healthy people are less prone to illness and given the dangers and costs 
 of medical care during the pandemic, this is an important factor. But no 
 less significantly, healthy people are happier and more productive; they 
 are better members of society and better workers.
