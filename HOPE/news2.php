<h4>How can organisations implement active health 
prevention policies?</h4>

<p>Governments and public health systems have been forced to deal with the 
immediate effects of the virus, and in efforts to contain it. This trend
 will undoubtedly continue into the future, as the public purse will come 
 under increasing pressure. As a result, prevention of sickness and the
 maintenance of health will not gain the interest and focus necessary, 
 a reality of significance to employers and organizations. These broader
 aspects of health need attention too – and not just for altruistic reasons. 
 Healthy people are less prone to illness and given the dangers and costs 
 of medical care during the pandemic, this is an important factor. But no 
 less significantly, healthy people are happier and more productive; they 
 are better members of society and better workers</p>

<p>When buying a TV package, you can end up paying 
for hundreds of channels you don’t want to watch, just to get the five 
channels that you do want. Some people would say that buying health insurance 
is a similarly painful process.</p><br>

<h4>HOPE Issues Guidance on American Rescue Plan <br>
Funding for Medicaid Home and Community Based Services</h4><br>

<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing guidance
 on how states can receive enhanced funding, provided through the American
 Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP), to increase access to home and community 
 based services (HCBS) for Medicaid beneficiaries. </p>
 
 <p>These benefits provide critical services to millions of older adults
 and individuals with disabilities, allowing them to receive health services 
 in their homes and communities, rather than in nursing homes
 and other institutions. </p>
