	<hr>
	<p>PPO plans, or "Preferred Provider Organization" plans, are one of the most popular types of plans in the Individual and Family market. PPO plans allow you to visit whatever in-network physician or healthcare provider you wish without first requiring a referral from a primary care physician.</p>

<h1><B>How does a PPO plan work?</B></h1>
<p><B>As a member of a PPO plan, you'll be encouraged to use the insurance company's network of preferred doctors and you usually won't need to choose a primary care physician. No matter which healthcare provider you choose, in-network healthcare services will be covered at a higher benefit level than out-of-network services. It's important to check if you provider accepts your health plan so you receive the highest level of benefit coverage.</B></p>
<p><B>You will probably have an annual deductible to pay before the insurance company starts covering your medical bills. You may also have a co-payment of about $10 - $30 for certain services or be required to cover a certain percentage of the total charges for your medical bills.</B></p>

<h2><B>A PPO plan may be right for you if:</B></h2>
<ul>
  <li><B>You want the freedom to choose almost any medical facility or provider for your healthcare needs</B></li>
  <li><B>You want a portion of out-of-network claims to be covered by your insurance company</B></li>
  <li><B>You don't want to get referrals before visiting a specialist</B></li>
</ul>
<h2><B>If you choose a PPO health plan, itâ€™s important to know:</B></h2>
<ul>
  <li><B>We recommend you choose a primary care provider (PCP) to serve as your personal health advocate and coordinate your health care, but it is not required.</B></li>
  <li><B>If you choose to get care outside of the network (such as a physician, hospital, clinic or pharmacy), those out-of-network services will be covered at a higher cost to you and will have to submit claims yourself. You will also need to meet a separate out-of-network deductible. However, eligible emergency care is always covered, even out-of-network.</B></li>
  <li><B>The PPO plan includes global emergency and urgent care coverage* 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</B></li>
